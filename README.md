# Langchain-Neo4j_database
# Introduction
This project integrates a Neo4j graph database with a large language model (LLM), enabling natural language querying and response generation. The integration leverages the LangChain framework to facilitate seamless interaction between the database and the LLM. For demonstration purposes, we use a publicly available movie dataset containing fields such as movie name, genre, actors, etc.

# Prerequisites
1. Python 3.7+
2. Neo4j 4.x or 5.x
3. LangChain
4. Any LLM models
5. Publicly available dataset (e.g., a movie dataset)
# Setup
1. Neo4j Installation
2. Download and install Neo4j from the official website.
3. Start the Neo4j server and access the Neo4j Browser at http://localhost:7474.
4. Set up authentication (username and password).
